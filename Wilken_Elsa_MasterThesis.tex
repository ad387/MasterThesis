\chapter{Volcanism and volcanic chemistry}

\section{Volcanism}
The high thermal energy in the deep interior of the earth is mostly well separated from the earth’s surface by the earth’s crust. A volcano is a geological structure that allows magma to reach the earth’s surface. Such a phenomenon can occur in various ways. In the following paragraphs the different types of volcanoes are described.
\paragraph{ Mid-ocean ridge volcanism}
The mid-ocean ridge volcanism can be traced back to tectonic processes of oceanic plates. The spreading of two plates, that are pulled apart, leads to a thinning of the oceanic earth crust. This way solid material from the upper mantel (lower than 100 km) can ascend to depths of approximately 50 km. As the pressure at this depth is much lower, the mantle material starts to melt to basaltic magma that fills the gap between the two plates.
\paragraph{ Continental rift zone volcanism}
Similar to mid-ocean ridge volcanism continental rift zone volcanism are located at two continental plates that are pulled apart.
\paragraph{ Subduction zone volcanoes}
Subduction zone volcanoes occur if an oceanic plate converges under another plate (oceanic or continental). This way the descending plate penetrate into the lower mantle. At a depth of 80-150 km the water of this plate evaporates and rises and causes the mantle material above to melt. The resulting water-rich magma mainly consists of andesite. Subduction zone volcanoes are known for their violent eruptions caused by the low viscosity magma.
\paragraph{ Hot-spot volcanoes} Hot-spot volcanoes occur on continental or oceanic plates. This type of volcanoes arises from a hot spot at the coremantle boundary inside earth that leads to a plume in the mantle where solid material can rise. This material melts to basaltic magma at a depth of 100-150 km. Through a futher rise also other types of magma (e.g. rhyolitic, more-viscous magma) can arise.


\section{Volcanic gases and their impact on the climate}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Bilder/Simon/Bilder_Tung/Climate_Influence}
	\caption{Influence of volcanic eruptions and quiet degassing on earth climate. Redrawn on the basis of \cite{robock2000volcanic}}
	\label{fig:climateinfluence}
\end{figure}
Volcanoes emit various gases (see \cref{tab.volcemissions}) in the atmosphere. This can occur due to volcanic eruptions or due quiet degassing. Gas emitted by quiet degassing remains in the troposphere while eruptions can inject volcanic gases up to the stratosphere \citet{robock2000volcanic}. The larger lifetime in the stratosphere and a larger sensitivity of the stratospheric chemistry to volcanic gases leads to an higher impact on the earth climate of these gases.
Volcanic gases have a large influence on the earth climate especially \ce{CO2} and \ce{SO2}  or more specific its oxidation product sulfur acid.\\ 
The relevance of  \ce{CO2} for the climate is a subject of many discussions about the climate change. Compared to other atmospheric \ce{CO2} sources, the share of volcanic  \ce{CO2} is rather low.\\
\\
Even though the \ce{SO2} emissions during eruptive episodes are up to one order higher than during quite degassing episodes, \cite{halmer2002annual} estimates that quiescent degassing contributes 40\% of the accumulated \ce{SO2} between 1972 to 2000.\\
\cite{halmer2002annual} estimated the mean annual \ce{SO2}  emitted from volcanoes from 1972 to 200 as 7.5 to 10.5TgSyr$^{-1}$, while the anthropogenic \ce{SO2}  amount for 2000 is estimated as 55TgSyr$^{-1}$ \citep{IPCC}. Despite the less \ce{SO2}  occurring from volcanoes the impact may be higher as the impact of the anthropogenic \ce{SO2}. \cite{graf1997volcanic} supposed that the volcanic \ce{SO2}  has a higher impact on the climate since its reaches up to the stratosphere while the anthropogenic \ce{SO2}  is mostly located in planetary boundary layer. In the lower troposphere sulphuric acid has a lifetime of about a week whereas the lifetime in the stratosphere is about a year \citep{IPCC}.\\
Sulphuric acid in the atmosphere increases the earth albedo due to direct backscattering radiation. Additional the condensation on sulphuric acid particles leads to finer droplets and thus to more stable and more white clouds. This increases the albedo as well \citep{twomey1974pollution}.
Volcanic particles can be surfaces for heterogeneous reaction. The result is a depletion of stratospheric ozone, and thus a more high energetic solar flux on the earth surface.
Large particles may backscatter IR radiation from the earth surface and the lower atmosphere, leading to a small reduction of the net cooling of the lower troposphere.
In the upper troposphere or stratosphere absorption of IR or UV radiation results in a net heating in the stratosphere and a cooling at the earth surface.
\Cref{fig:climateinfluence} shows the above described effects and their localization in the atmosphere.
The dominating radiative effect of volcanic gases is a cooling of the earth atmosphere due to  more backscattered radiation, more diffusive scattering\citep{robock2000volcanic}.
\cite{IPCC} records a volcanic radiative forcing of $-0.11Wm^{-1}$ between 2008 and 2011. For comparison the radiative of  \ce{CO2} is estimated as  $1.68Wm^{-1}$.





\section{Volcanic degassing}
\section{Volcanic plume chemistry}
Volcanoes are emitter of many gases and aerosols particles, which are rising and forming the volcanic plume. 
The temperature where the gases and aerosols are emitted is approximately 500$^{\circ}C$ \citet{gerlach2004volcanic}.
Due to the high temperatures the gas raises, cools down and mix up with ambient air. This process leads to many chemical reactions. The large amount of aerosols catalyses heterogeneous reactions.\\
The volcanic gases are listed in \Cref{tab.volcemissions}.\\
In the following the chemical reactions of the plume constituents \ce{BrO}  and \ce{SO2} will be discussed. This are the gases observed in this thesis.

\end{table}

\subsection{Sulphur species\label{chap:so2}}
Sulphur species are the third most abundant gases in volcanic plumes. Hereby \ce{SO2} contributes with about 25\% and \ce{H2S} with 1 to 10\%. Only \ce{H2O} and \ce{CO2} have a larger share on the volcanic gases in the plume \Cref{tab.volcemissions}.\\
Outside of the volcanic plume the \ce{SO2}  amount is negligible with approximately 1ppb. In contrast the \ce{SO2}  amount inside he plume can easily reach 1ppm \cite{Coppenheimer 2003}
When \ce{H2S} escapes from the volcano vent, it enters the oxidizing conditions in the atmosphere. The conversion of \ce{H2S} into \ce{SO2} starts with:
\begin{equation*}
\ce{H2O}+\ce{OH}\rightarrow \ce{H2O}+\ce{SH}
\end{equation*}
The \ce{SH} radical goes through a series of reactions, leading to the \ce{SO2} formation \cite{Seinfeld}\\
\ce{SO2} is removed from the atmosphere by dry or wet
deposition. At homogeneous reactions the lifetime is from 1-3 weeks \cite{robock2000volcanic}. Heterogeneous reactions that take place on particles or liquid phases lead to much faster depletions. But this has not yet been observed in volcanic plume measurements.\\
Further discussions of the stability of \ce{SO2}  in the atmosphere can be found at \cite{lubcke2014optical}.\\
However, \ce{SO2} can be considered as stable several hours after the release of the volcanic vent.\\ The long lifetime  alongside with the negligible amount of \ce{SO2} in the atmospheric background makes \ce{SO2} a good tracer of the volcanic plume.
Therefore relative to other trace gases \ce{SO2} may be used to examine their evolution independent of the plume dispersion.\\
One attempt to use \ce{SO2} to examine other trace gases is made by \cite{bobrowski2007reactive}. They found a higher BrO/\ce{SO2} ratio at the edges of volcano plumes (Mt. Etna on Sicily, Italy, in August–October 2004 and May 2005 and Villarica in Chile in November 2004) and concluded that the BrO amount is higher at the edges due to the insufficient mixing with ozone rich air inside of the plume (see \ref{fig:broplume}).\\
In this thesis it is assumed that \ce{SO2}  is stable on time-scales occurring with ground based remote sensing measuring of about 20 minutes. \\



\subsection{Bromine oxide}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Bilder/Simon/Bilder_Tung/BrO_Plume}
	\caption{schematic sketch of a Bromine Explosion.
		Release of \ce{HBr} at the volcanic vent. Mixing with ambient air in the effective source region leads to \ce{Br} formation. This resulting Bromine species react to \ce{BrO} with ozone from the plume. Adapted from \cite{bobrowski2007reactive}}
	\label{fig:broplume}
\end{figure}
The amount of bromine in volcanic plumes is rather low compared to \ce{SO2}. The first time Bromine monoxid (BrO) was observed at a volcano was 2013 at the soufriere hills by \cite{bobrowski2003detection}. Since then many others were able to detect \ce{BrO}  using ground based remote sensing measurement techniques (DOAS: see \Cref{DOAS}) for example:
\citet{bobrowski2007so2}, \citet{bobrowski2007reactive},\citet{vogel2011volcanic} and \cite{lubcke2014bro}
\\
The main Bromine formation which is released from the volcano is  \ce{HBr}. \ce{BrO}  is formed due to mixing with the ozone rich atmosphere at ambient temperatures \cite{bobrowski2007reactive}.\\
Due to the raising of hot air in the volcano vent , ambient air is pulled into the vent. There temperatures of  600$^{\circ}C$ to 1200$^{\circ}C$    prevent the formation of \ce{BrO}. Only Br is formed. \ce{BrO}  occur after further cooling and mixing while rising. When the temperature cooles down to ambient conditions the so called "Bromine Explosion" causes a non linear formation of \ce{BrO}.
The "Bromine Explosion" is illustrated in \Cref{fig:broexplosion} and can be described with the following reaction cycle:
\begin{align}
\ce{HBr}_{gas} &\rightarrow \ce{Br}^{-}_{aq} + \ce{H}^{+}_{aq} \label{eq1}\\
\ce{HOBr}_{(gas)} &\rightarrow \ce{HOBr}_{(aq)} \\
\ce{HOBr}_{(aq)} + \ce{Br}^{-}_{(aq)} + \ce{H}^{+}_{(aq)} &\rightarrow
\ce{Br}_{2(aq)} +  \ce{H2O}\label{eq2}\\
\ce{Br}_{2,aq} &\rightarrow \ce{Br}_{2,gas} \\
\ce{Br2} + h\nu &\rightarrow 2 \ce{Br} \\
\ce{Br} + \ce{O3} &\rightarrow \ce{BrO} + \ce{O2} \\
\ce{BrO} + \ce{HO2} &\rightarrow \ce{HOBr} + \ce{O2} \\
\ce{BrO} + \ce{BrO} &\rightarrow 2 \ce{Br} + \ce{O2} \\
\ce{BrO} + \ce{BrO} &\rightarrow \ce{Br2} + \ce{O2}
\end{align}
The gaseous \ce{HBr} emitted by the volcano is splited heterogeneously int H$^{+}$ and Br$^{-}$ (\cref{eq1}). Inside of an aerosol it forms with HOBr \ce{Br2} and \ce{H2O} (\cref{eq2}). \ce{Br2} evaporates to the gaseous phase and splits photolytic  into 2Br. Including an ozon molecule (\ce{O3}) the two Br react to 2BrO. The last step o the circle visualized in \Cref{fig:broexplosion} with blue lines is the reaction of a BrO with \ce{H2O} to an HOBrO molecule condensing into the liquid phase  and thuse closing the circle. The non linear explosion occurs due the formation of two BrO particles from one \ce{Hbr} from the volcano.\\
The BrO formation is slightly diminished due to self reaction of BrO molecules marked with the red lines in \cref{fig:broexplosion}. The 2BrO react with themselves and form \ce{Br2} or may split photolyticaly into 2Br.\\
The BrO concentration reaches a maximum approximately 5 minutes after emission and then remains constant for the next 25 minutes \citet{lubcke2014bro}.

\section{Using the \ce{BrO}/\ce{SO2}  ratio to study volcanic activity}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Zwischenbericht2018/Bilder/so2_bro}
	\caption{Dependency of the ratios of different volcanic trace gases on depth. Data originate from Stromboli volcano. From \cite{lubcke2014optical} reproduced from Burton et al. (2007)}
	\label{fig:so2bro}
\end{figure}    
	
	Volcanic degassing is influenced by many factors, which can be exploit to study volcanic activity by using the gas composition of the volcano plume. Therefore remote sensing should be an additional tool for forecasting of volcanic activity next to classical monitoring techniques like seismographic and deformation measurements.\\
	Inside of volcanoes volatiles are in solution in magmatic melt. The Henry law \Cref{Henrylaw} describes the necessary conditions for gas formation:
	\begin{equation}
	P = K_{H}\cdot c
	\label{Henrylaw}
	\end{equation}
	Here P is the partial pressure at equilibrium of the solute, c is the concentration and $ K_{H}$ is the Henry constant which is anti proportional to the solubility $\alpha$ ($\alpha = \frac{1}{ K_{H}}$).
	If the partial pressure of the gas solute (in this case a magmatic gas constituent) exceeds the pressure of the surrounding solvent, a formation of gaseous bubbles occur. Otherwise, if the partial pressure of the gas in the solution is below the surrounding pressure the formation of gas bubbles stops.\\
	The solubility $\alpha$ depends on the temperature, the chemical composition and on the solvent (here magma). Whereas the partial pressure of the constituent depends on the surrounding pressure. The pressure below the volcanic vent increases with depth, this leads to a correlation between the partial pressure of the constituents and the depth.
	The result is, that the gas starts exsolving at a certain depth depending on the  partial pressure of the constituent. Thus the gas bubble formation increases with rising magma. But at a certain depth the percentage of solved gas is different for each volcanic gas. The result is, that the composition of the gases changes with depth. So gas ratios contain information about its originating source depth.\\
	Prior to volcanic eruptions the magma starts raising since the gas is mostly less dense than the magma, it raises faster and could be therefore a indicator for its origin source depth thus a indicator for the volcanic activity.\\
	\Cref{fig:so2bro} shows the ratios of  \ce{H2O} / \ce{CO2},S/CL, \ce{CO2}/S as a function of the pressure respectively on the depth.
	%
	\citet{noguchi1963prediction} found decrease Cl/S prior to eruptive periods
	%
	\citet{pennisi1998variations} observed lower CL/S ratio during eruptive periods than not eruptive periods at Mt. Etna.
	%
	\citet{burton2007magmatic}  found \ce{CO2}/\ce{SO2} and \ce{SO2}/hCl ratios 3-5 times higher during explosions  compared to quiet degassing episodes.
	%
	the authors compared these data to gas formation simulations for different degassing source depth they concluded that these eruptions were driven by gas slugs from deeper levels where the ratios were higher while quiet degassing originates from from shallow magma\\
	%
	Especially halogen-sulfur ratios are interesting as possible tracer for the volcanic activity since the ambient air concentrations are negligible
	BrO/\ce{SO2}  curves equivalent as in \Cref{fig:so2bro} are yet not available due to lack of  bromine solubility curve but the following observations were made:
	%
	Changes of \ce{BrO}/\ce{SO2}  were found by \citet{bobrowski2006bromine}: multiple eruptions between 2006 and 2009 highest ratios 2-3 month before the eruptions the ratio then decreased and was lowest during eruptive phase. Therefore it could be concluded that bromine exsolves earlier, at lower depth than sulphur.
	%
	\citet{lubcke2014bro} found decrease of \ce{BrO}  5 month prior to th eruption 2012 at Nevado Del Ruiz can also be attributed to a earlier exsolution of bromine during rising magma.
	%
	Despite the lack of the solubility curve of \ce{BrO}  until now, the \ce{BrO}/\ce{SO2}  has a great potential for investigations of the volcanic activity. The first reason is, that both gases can be measured with remote sensing by DOAS instruments. For examples ground based measurements by \cite{bobrowski2007reactive}, \cite{lubcke2014optical} or satellite based measurement by \cite{Hörman et al 2013} or \cite{Beirle at al 2014}. The advantage of remote sensing techniques is the possibility of measuring during eruptions which is with in situ measurements not always possible.
	Secondly due to the NOVAC network (See \ref{NOVAC}) continues measurements are possible.\\
	Another reason for the research on \ce{BrO}/\ce{SO2}  ratios at volcanoes is the constance of the ratio from 5 to at least 30 minutes after release \citep{bobrowski2007reactive};\citep{lubcke2014optical}. As well as the constance from 5 to 20 km off the volcano see \ref{fig:ratdiff}. This ensures that the data measured from different positions or at different conditions are comparable.\\
	\\
	This chapter motivated the research on the \ce{BrO}/\ce{SO2}  ratio as a tracer for volcanic activity.

	Tungurahua is a steep-sided andesitic-dacitic subduction zone volcano located in the Ecuadorian Andes (Lat: 1.467$^{\circ}$S; Long: 78.442$^{\circ}$W). 2014 Tungurahua was one of the most active volcanoes in southern America, since then the activity was decreasing. Tungurahua is 5023m high and is one of the defining volcanoes of the eastern volcanic rows in Ecuador \citep{hall1999tungurahua}.
	\\
	The modern volcano was formed by a sequentially construction of three major edifices on a basement of metamorphic rocks. It has a total diameter of 12 km. Tungurahua I was roughly located at the same place as today and was build up in the mid-Pleistocene, mainly by andesitic and dacitic lava flows as well as interbedded tephra. Tungurahua II was formed in the past 14,000 years as a result of the collapse of the initial edifice.\\
	3000 years ago the Tungurahua II edifice collapse. The collapse of Tungurahua II produced a large debris-avalanche deposit and a horseshoe-shaped caldera which is open to the west side. Tungurahua III the current glacier caped stratovolcano was constructed in this caldera \citep{GlobalVolcanismProgram}.\\
	The current ongoing long term eruption started in October 1999. The eruptive ohase was preceded by hydrothermal tremors between 1994 and 1997 \citep{samaniego}\textcolor{red}{reference finden}.\\
	From September 1998 to July 1999 an increase of seismic activity like volcano tectonic earthquakes indicates the raising of magma. This eruptive phase is characterized by alternating periods of high and low volcanic activity. \\

	At Tungurahua three instruments described  in \Cref{tab:TInstruments}, with data recorded in the time span from July in 2008 to August in 2009 are used in this thesis.
	\Cref{tab:TInstruments} shows the exact position, of the instruments, the altitude, and other specifications of the instrument. \\

	\subsection*{Nevado Del Ruiz}
	Nevado Del Ruiz is a glacier-covered, subduction zone volcano which is located in the Central Cordillera of Colombia, 140 km west of Bogota
	(Lat: 4.892$^{\circ}$N; Long: 75.324$^{\circ}$W). Nevado De Ruiz has a hight of 5389 m and covers an area of more than 200 km$^2$.
	Three major edifices has been constructed since the beginning of the Pleistocene, consisting of andesitic and dacitic lavas and pyrolastics \citep{GlobalVolcanismProgram}. \\
	The current cone is build within the caldera of older edifice and consists of a cluster of lava domes. The crater on the summit the name is Arenas crater, with a diameter of 1 km and a depth of 240 m. 
	The last big eruption was in 1985. This was South America's deadliest eruption.\\
	In this thesis the data of two NOVAC instruments (see \Cref{tab:NVDRInstruments}) in the time from the end of 2009 to the end of 2011 are used. \\

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,
	Atoms and molecules exists in several energy states, depending on the different electron configuration. Moreover molecules have additionally rotation and vibration states, also enclose to the energy states. If a photon energy matches the energy gap between two possible energy states, this includes, that the lower energy state is occupied and the selection rules are fulfilled  the molecule could absorb the photon, remaining in a higher energy state.\\
	The additional energy could be loosed by collision with another molecule or by emission. But since the direction of the emitted photon is mostly not the same direction of the absorbed photon the intensity I$_{0}$ of the light before passing the medium is higher than the intensity I after travelling the distance L through the medium.\\
	This can be described as:\\ 
	\begin{equation}
	I\left(L,\lambda\right) = I_{0}\left(\lambda\right)\cdot exp\left(-\int^{L}_{0}\sigma\left(\lambda,p(l),T(l)\right)\cdot c\left(l\right)dl\right)
	\end{equation}
	where $\lambda$ is the wavelength,$c\left(l\right)$ is the location-dependent concentration of the trace gas of interest. $\sigma\left(\lambda,p,T\right)$ is the absorption cross section, $\sigma\left(\lambda,p,T\right)$ is unique for each molecule and depends on pressure p and on the temperature T.\\
	%
	An important quantity used in many optical remote sensing techniques is the optical density $\tau$. The optical density is a measure for the weakening of radiation when going through a material. At a volcano the variation of temperature and pressure in different viewing angles is negligible, thus, $\sigma\left(\lambda,p(l),T(l)\right)$ is independent of $l$ required to consider it within the integral. Then  $\tau$ can be calculated using the Beer-Lambert law:
	\begin{equation}
	\tau = ln\left(\frac{I_{0}\left(\lambda\right)}{I\left(\lambda\right)}\right) = \sigma\cdot S
	\end{equation}
	The column density $S$ can be calculated as:
	\begin{equation}
	S = \int_{0}^{L}c\left(l\right)dl
	\end{equation}
	The column density is the concentration of the trace gas when integrating along the light path, the dimension of $S$ is therefore the number of molecules divided by an area: $\frac{molec}{cm^2}$.\\

	When measuring in atmosphere, the situations gets more complex, since we need to deal with several absorbers and scattering processes have to be taken into account. 
	Scattering processes in the atmosphere can be roughly grouped in Rayleigh scattering, scattering at very small particles and Mie scattering, scattering at larger particles (radius$\approx \lambda$). The effects on the spectrum caused by scattering need to be considered in the calculations.  One possibility is to treat scattering effects as pseudo absorbers with the respective extinction coefficients for Rayleigh ($\epsilon_R$) and  Mie ($\epsilon_M$) scattering.

	Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) was invented in the late 1970s by \cite{perner1979detection}. This section will give an overview about the DOAS technique. More detailed information ca be found in the work of \cite{platt2008differential}\\
	DOAS uses the fact that the broad bands effect do not need to be quantified to determine the column density.
	Therefore it is not necessary to apply \Cref{eq:lbe} to real measurements.\\
	\newline
%	\textcolor{red}{Das hier ist ist unter (mathematischer)Debatte. Zumindest bei MAX-DOAS wird das nämlich eigentlich gar nicht gemacht. Der DOAS fit unterteilt gar nicht in Breitband und Schmalband. Die Erklärung hier ist eher eine Illustration wie man sich den DOAS fit vorstellen kann. IM Prinzip ist dieser Abschnitt redundant. Das steht (leider) so nicht im DOAS Buch. Ich bin hier aber voreingenommen. Zu diesem Abschnitt solltest du dir andere Meinungen einholen. ;-) : nicole sat dazu: den Kommentar verstehe ich nicht, falls doch stimmt das geasagte aber nicht }
	Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy uses the fact, that absorption can be divided into broad-band parts and narrow-band parts. Broad band parts are effects that only changes weakly with the wavelength,  i.e. scattering and instruments effects have a broad-band structure. 
	The narrow band part includes effects that strongly depends on the wavelength.
	Within the DOAS-Method only narrow-band absorption features of molecules are used to obtain their column densities.
	The absorption cross section of trace gases $j$ have broad-band ($\sigma_b\left(\lambda \right)$) and narrow band ($\sigma{'}\left(\lambda \right)$) features, only the narrow-band structures are used in DOAS.
	\begin{equation}
	\sigma\left(\lambda \right) = \sigma_b\left(\lambda \right) + \sigma{'}\left(\lambda \right)
	\end{equation}

	%
	With this considerations the Beer-Lambert law \Cref{eq:lbe} can be rewritten
	dividing the exponential part into a narrow-band part and a broad-band part:

	\begin{align}
	I\left(\lambda,L\right) = &\overbrace{I_{0}\left(\lambda\right)\cdot exp\left(-\int^{L}_{0}\sum_{j}\sigma_{b,j}\left(\lambda,p,T\right)\cdot c_{j}\left(l\right)+\epsilon_R\left(\lambda,l\right)+\epsilon_{M}\left(\lambda,l\right)dl\right)}^{=I^{'}_0\left(\lambda\right)} \cdot \nonumber \\
	&exp\left(-\int^{L}_{0}\sum_{j}\sigma_{j}^{'}\left(\lambda,p,T\right)\cdot c_{j}\left(l\right)dl\right)
	\label{eq:bb}
	\end{align}	
		%
	The so defined $I^{'}_0\left(\lambda\right)$ differs from $I_0\left(\lambda\right)$ only by broad band effects. With $I^{'}_0\left(\lambda\right)$ a differential optical density $\tau^{'}$ can be defined:
	\begin{equation}
	\tau^{'} = ln\left(\frac{I^{'}_0\left(\lambda\right)}{I\left(\lambda\right)}\right) = \int_{0}^{L} \sum_{j} \sigma^{'}_{j} \cdot \left(\lambda\right) \cdot c_{j}\left(l\right)dl = \sum_{j}\sigma^{'}_{j}\left(\lambda\right)\cdot S_{j}
	\label{eq:taustrich}
	\end{equation}
	
	The optical density can now be calculated by using the difference of the column density $S_{M}$ in the measurement spectrum to the column density $S_{R}$ of a reference spectrum. From \Cref{eq:bb} we know:	
	\begin{equation}
	I_{P,R} = I^{'}_{0}\cdot exp\left(-S_{P,R}\cdot\sigma\left(\lambda\right)\right)
	\label{eq:smr}
	\end{equation}
	In general the obtained column density $S_{M}$ is called differential slant column density: "dSCD". If the reference spectrum does not contain the trace gas of interest (is not contaminated with trace gases) that means $S_{R} = 0$, $S_{M}$ is called the slant column	density (SCD). 
	With \Cref{eq:smr} the optical density can be derived by:
	\begin{equation}
	\tau\left(\lambda\right) = -ln\left(\frac{I_{M}}{I_{R}}\right) = \sigma\left(\lambda\right)\cdot\left(S_{M}-S_{R}\right)
	\end{equation}

	\subsection{Technical implementation of the DOAS approach}
	\textcolor{red}{Hier könnte man schon mal expliziter aufzeigen, wie eine andere Temperatur T + delta T zu einem Fehler führt. Als Vorbereitung für deine späteren Untersuchungen von delta T}
	The theory explained above only describes the ideally situation. In real measurements more problems occur due to instrument limitations inelastic scattering causing the Ring effect and due to impacts of external parameters like temperature.\\
	In the following a short overview about these problems and their consequences for our retrieval is given. Further information can be found in \cite{lubcke2014optical}.\\
	\subsubsection*{Optical and spectral resolution of the spectrometer}
	The resolution of the spectrometer is finite, thus, the detector receives a spectrum $I^{*}\left(\lambda\right)$ which can be retrieved with a convolution of the incident spectrum $I\left(\lambda\right)$ with the instrument function H$\left(\lambda\right)$:
	\begin{equation}
	I^{*}\left(\lambda\right) = I\left(\lambda\right)*H\left(\lambda\right)=\int I\left(\lambda-\lambda{'}\right)\cdot H\left(\lambda-\lambda{'}\right)d\lambda{'}
	\end{equation} 
	For the evaluation all $\sigma_{j}$  of the trace gases of interest need to have the same spectral resolution as the instrument used for recording the spectra. In this work we will use high resolution cross sections and convolute them with the instrument function H:
	\begin{equation}
	\sigma{*}\left(\lambda\right) = \sigma\left(\lambda\right)*H\left(\lambda\right)
	\end{equation}
	\textcolor{red}{bessere Darstellung zu $\sigma{*}$}
	The instrument function H can be approximated by using a the spectral lines of an mercury lamp since the width of those lines is only a few pm, they could be treated as delta peaks when comparing it to the resolution of the spectrometers.
	
	\subsubsection*{Effects of the detector}
	The detector only has discrete pixels, therefore a wavelength interval is mapped to a pixel $i$.
	
	\begin{equation}
	I^{'}\left(i\right) = \int_{\lambda(i)}^{\lambda(i+1)}I^{*}\left(\lambda{'}d\right)d\lambda{'}
	\end{equation}
	For the retrieval the relationship between the detector channels and the wavelength of the spectrum need to be known.
	The wavelength to pixel mapping (WPM) for a detector with q channels can be calculated as:

	\begin{eqnarray}
	\lambda(i) = \sum_{k=0}^{q-1}\gamma_{k}\cdot i^{k}
	\end{eqnarray}
	Hereby, is $\gamma_{0}$ a shift of the spectrum and $\gamma_{1}$ is a squeeze (respectively stretch) of the spectrum.
	The wavelength to pixel mapping can be discovered by using a mercury lamp again and compare pixel-position with the well known wavelength of the individual HG-lines of the mercury lamp.\\
	The wavelength to pixel mapping depends on the instrument temperature as well as on the ambient pressure \citep{lubcke2014bro}.
	\subsubsection*{Ring effect}
	As mentioned above inelastic scattering causes the Ring effect (named after Grainger and Ring, 1962).
	The Ring effect is observable through a filling of the Fraunehofer lines in spectra of scattered solar radiation, (e.g. if the sunlight travels through the earth atmosphere). When compared to direct sunlight measurements (e.g. outside of the earth atmosphere).
	(\cite{bussemer1993ring},\cite{solomon1987interpretation}) identified rotational Raman scattering mainly of
	\ce{O2} and \ce{N2} in the atmosphere as the origin of the Ring effect.
	\cite{solomon1987interpretation} suggested to treat the Ring effect as a pseudo-absorber.

	\subsection*{Dependency of external parameters on each other}
	In all discussions on the impact of the external parameter on the retrieved \ce{BrO}  error the  dependency of the external parameter on each other are neglected. It is plausible that the temperature correlates with the cloudiness or the lightness due to sunlight. Therefore the correlation of the exposure time with the \ce{BrO}  error could be a result of the correlation of the temperature with the \ce{BrO}  error. \Cref{fig:difference-in-exposure-time-msdifference-in-temperature-ctungu} shows an example of the dependency of external parameters on each other. The difference in temperature as a function of the difference in exposure time. The \ce{BrO}  error is color-coded. \\
	All correlations between the external parameters are shown in \Cref{fig:varcorrelationmatrix}. \Cref{fig:varcorrelationmatrix} shows discrete correlation values from 0.3 to 1. Correlations below 0.3 are ignored. Small plus and minus signs indicate whether the correlation is negative or positive. 
	The temperature depends on the daytime, due to the dependence of the temperature on the sun, thus a correlation between the  difference in temperature and the difference in daytime (Correlation of $\approx$ 0.5) can be observed. Since the temperature depends on the intensity of the sun, it also correlates with  the difference in exposure time (Correlation of $\approx$ 0.4). The difference in temperature also slightly correlates with the difference in colorindex, due to the dependency of temperature on the cloudiness (Correlation of $\approx$ 0.3). The low correlations could appear due to the uniform cloudiness near to the equator. The correlation between the temperature difference to the temporal difference (Correlation of $\approx$ 0.3) probably occurs due to long term changes in temperature. Furthermore the difference in exposure time correlates with the daytime and the colorindex (Correlation of $\approx$ 0.4) as a result of the dependency on the sun intensity.\\

	\end{figure}
%
	To eliminate the correlation between the external parameters the \ce{BrO}  error dependency on one external parameter where calculated by keeping the differences in the other external parameters constant. Hereby only parameters were kept constant, where the correlation is above 0.3. Thus, when looking at the temperature, only the difference in temperature need to be constant, since the temporal distance does not correlate wit the other considered external parameter. The results can be seen in \Cref{fig:datwithoutotherparamallinstruments} to \Cref{fig:diffdaytimewithoutotherparamallinstruments}.\\
	\\
	\Cref{fig:datwithoutotherparamallinstruments} shows the BrO retrieval error as a function of the temporal difference between the reference and the plume spectrum. All differences in temperature are below one degree. Compared to the correlations, calculated without eliminating the dependence on the temperature, the correlations increase. The dependence of the instruments installed at Tungurahua are still significant higher. From the results can be interpreted that the temporal difference between the time when measuring the plume and the reference has a impact on the fit quality, but this impact is smaller as the impact of the instrument temperature.\\
	\Cref{fig:diffexptimewithoutotherparamallinstruments} shows the dependency of the BrO retrieval error on the difference in exposure time for all considered instruments. Hereby, only data are used, where the difference in temperature is below 1 degree, the difference in colorindex is below 0.05 and the difference in daytime is below one hour. The temporal difference and the difference in elevation angle are not kept constant, since we could not observe a relation between the exposure time and the temporal difference or the elevation angle. The correlations between the BrO error and the difference in exposure time decrease for each instrument if the temperature, daytime and colorindex are kept constant. Even though, the correlations at Nevado Del Ruiz are still higher as the correlations at Tungurahua.\\
	\Cref{fig:diffcolidxwithoutotherparamallinstruments} shows the BrO retrieval error as a function of the difference in colorindex for all instruments. The temperature and the exposure time shows a dependency on the colorindex as it can be seen in \Cref{fig:varcorrelationmatrix}. Both are kept constant, the difference in temperature is below 1 degree and the difference in exposure time is below 100 ms. The correlations decrease compared to \Cref{fig:diffcolidx}. Especially the correlation of the D2J2201\_0 instrument decreases.\\
	\Cref{fig:diffdaytimewithoutotherparamallinstruments} shows the BrO retrieval error as a function of the difference in daytime for all considered instruments. As it can be seen in \cref{fig:varcorrelationmatrix} the exposure time and the temperature need to be kept constant. The difference in temperature is below 1 degree, the difference in exposure time belwo 100 ms. A general decrease of the correlations compared to \Cref{fig:diffdaytime} is observable.\\
	Restricting the data, to where the temperature difference is kept below one degree, leads to an distortion of the data. Thus the results plotted in \Cref{fig:datwithoutotherparamallinstruments} to \Cref{fig:diffdaytimewithoutotherparamallinstruments} could also have systematic errors.\\
	When comparing the correlations of the data from \Cref{fig:datwithoutotherparamallinstruments} and \Cref{fig:diffexptimewithoutotherparamallinstruments}  to the correlations of 
	\Cref{fig:datallinstruments} to \Cref{fig:diffexptime} a large reduction of the correlation is obvious. Only the difference in temperature still shows a significant correlation to the \ce{BrO}  error. However, the minimal \ce{BrO}  error coincidence in almost all cases with a difference in external parameters of zero. A dependency of the \ce{BrO}  error on the external parameter can still be seen even tough the correlation is very small. \\
	Excluding of the external parameters due to the rather low correlation leads to a worse quality of the results, since the effects of the single parameter add up to a not negligible amount. However, note that  the added impact of all external parameter except for the temperature are less important than the temperature.
	The BrO error of contaminated spectra evaluated with the contamination based method (See \Cref{chapt:contbased}) increases by 15\% if the other external parameters are excluded. If all external paramter except for the temperature are used the calculated BrO error increases by 37\%.\\
	\\
	For the final evaluation of contaminated data we use the results of \Cref{fig:difftemp} to \Cref{fig:diffcolidx}. Since the correlations between the external parameters are considered in the final 4 dimensional fit.\\

	\section{\ce{BrO}  dependence on external parameters\label{Chap:BrOdep}}
	The external parameters not only influence the fit quality but also the evaluation of the gas amount. A high different in certain external parameter could distort the calculated \ce{BrO}  column density. \Cref{fig:d2j2140060218difftemperature-cbro} shows the evaluation of one plume with respect to different references. The temporal difference between the references and the plume do not exceed two weeks. In theory we expect that the choice of  the reference should not make a difference, therefore all BrO column densities resulting from the evaluation should be equivalent. But we can see a high variation if choosing different references. The variability of the BrO column density depends as well on the external parameters, when looking at the temperature dependency a mean decrease of th BrO column density with an increasing temperature can be observed.

	\Cref{fig:d2j2140060218difftemperature-cbro} is a result of an exemplary evaluation of one plume. An examination of all several plumes evaluated by different references is shown in \Cref{fig:difftempbroallinstruments}. The plots are equivalent to the plots for BrO error (for an example see \cref{fig:difftemp}). The BrO SCDs vary strongly with the differences in external parameters. It is observable, that the BrO SCDs recorded by the instruments at Nevado Del Ruiz vary in a larger range than for the BrO SCDs recorded by instruments at Tungurahua. This can also be observed for the BrO retrieval errors. The absolute BrO SCDs increase with the difference in external parameters.\\
	 (a) Temporal difference: For the temporal difference no significant correlation can be observed. (b) Difference in color index: The correlations differ for every instrument even for instruments of the same volcano. The correlations vary from -0.368 to 0.46. (c) Difference in daytime: For the instruments at Nevado Del Ruiz the BrO SCD correlates strongly with the difference in daytime. This can be a result of the dependence on the temperature, since the correlations are very similiar, only the correlations are a little bit stronger for the difference in temperature. (d) The strange dependence which can be seen between the BrO error and the difference in elevation angle for the D2J2200 instrumnt can be seen in this plot as well. The other instruments do not show any correlation between the BrO SCD and the difference in elevation angle.(e) The correlations for the difference in exposure time are opposite to the correlations in daytime. 
%	\Cref{fig:onerefd2j2140060218difftemperature-cbro} shows the exemplary evaluation of different plumes by on reference. Here we assume different column densities, but this variability should be independent of the difference in the external parameters. But \Cref{fig:onerefd2j2140060218difftemperature-cbro} shows a clear dependence on the Temperature. The correlation for this example is -0.76, thus it can be concluded, that here is also an significant dependence.

	\subsection*{Summary}
This chapter examines the influence of external on the precision of the BrO evaluation. Herby the following parameter are considered: 
temporal difference, temperature, daytime, colorindex, elevation angle, exposure time.  The findings are based on the data of three instruments installed at the Tungurahua volcano and two instruments at the Nevado Del Ruiz volcano. The maximal temporal difference between measuring the plume and the reference is set to 14 days to prevent large uncertainties in the BrO evaluation. Due to the mechanical influence on the wavelength to pixel mapping the temperature for all analysed instruments has the most significant impact on the BrO evaluation for all considered external parameters. The elevation angle does not seem to influence the evaluation for all examined instruments thus the elevation is excluded from the evaluation. The influence of the other external parameter change at every instrument. So a relatively strong impact of the exposure time can be seen at the D2J2201\_0 instrument at Nevado Del Ruiz, while the exposure time does not seem to significantly influence the evaluation of the data from the  I2J8548\_0 at Tungurahua.

\chapter{Contamination based method \label{chapt:contbased}}
\textcolor{red}{Soweit ich verstanden habe, haben die "Other Approaches" keine Relevanz für dein Ergebnis. Aber sie stören den Lesefluss. Ich würde sie in den Appendix schieben.}\\
\textcolor{red}{Wir brauchen einen anderen Namen dafür. Und man sollte hervorheben, dass das ein optionales Modul ist. Soll heißen, man kann es direkt in den Algorithmus einbauen und somit alles andere unverändert weiterverwenden. Erster Vorschlag für Namen: "Decontamination module"}
	Based on the findings about the influence of external parameters on the \ce{BrO} error we propose an algorithm which is able to pick an appropriate volcanic-trace-gas free reference. The algorithm uses the dependencies found in \Cref{Chap:BROErr} to find a sufficiently good matching reference. The input is a list of ambient conditions.\\ 
	The first step is, to evaluate every reference with solar atlas spectrum, to check for contamination. A reference is classified as contaminated if the fit against the solar atlas spectrum yields an SO2 SCD above the plume limit ($2\cdot 10^{17}$).\\
	\\
	In the second step we determine for each contaminated reference:
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Bilder/Cont}
		\caption{Visualization of the contamination based Method. A list of possible references is available, where the temporal difference between the plume and the reference is not longer than two weeks. For every possible reference, the estimated BrO error is calculated by considering the corresponding difference in important external parameters. The reference with the so calculated minima BrO error is used for the evaluation.}
		\label{fig:Cont}
	\end{figure}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item We create a list of possible references where all references are not contaminated and the temporal distance to the plume date is no longer than 14 days.
		\item For all possible references we calculate the differences in the external parameters with respect to the corresponding plume spectrum.
		\item We use the analysis of external parameters as described in \Cref{Chap:BROErr} to estimate the \ce{BrO} error of all references
		\item We choose the reference with the smallest estimated \ce{BrO} error as new reference
		\item We evaluate the plume spectra of the corresponding scan with the new reference.
	\end{itemize}

	%
	$\epsilon_{0}$ is the \ce{BrO} error when evaluate the plume spectrum with the "same-time-reference".
	The assumption is, that the \ce{BrO} error $\epsilon_{BrO}$ can be described as the sum of $\epsilon_{0}$ and the deviation of $\epsilon_{BrO}$ with respect to all external parameters. It is limited by the accurateness of the NOVAC-instruments.
	\begin{align}
		\epsilon_{BrO} &=  \epsilon_{0}+\frac{d\epsilon}{dt}+\frac{d\epsilon}{d ^{\circ}}+\frac{d\epsilon}{dT}+\frac{d\epsilon}{dDt} +\frac{d\epsilon}{dc} + \mathcal{O}\left(OP\right) \\
		\rightarrow \Delta \epsilon_{BrO} &= \epsilon_{BrO} - \epsilon_{0} =\frac{d\epsilon}{dt}+\underbrace{\frac{d\epsilon}{d ^{\circ}}}_{=0}+\frac{d\epsilon}{dT}+\frac{d\epsilon}{ddt} +\frac{d\epsilon}{dc} + \mathcal{O}\left(OP\right) 
		\label{calc:err}
	\end{align}
	Here the parameter t stands for the time between plume-time and reference-time. The parameter T is the difference in temperature. The parameters Dt and c are the differences in the daytime and the colorindex. The term $\mathcal(OP)$ accounts for other excluded external parameters.
	The task occurring at this stage is to find the best representation for the deviations. An then find the reference which minimize $\Delta \epsilon_{BrO} $\\
	%
	\\
	%
	The easiest way is to just calculate the \ce{BrO} error of all possible references for every plume by using the DOASIS routine. If this method is used it is possible to choose the reference for which the \ce{BrO} error is minimal. However this takes to much computation time since the evaluation time would be proportional to the number of possible references because the evaluation needs to be done for $\mathcal{O}(n)$ with $n$ as the number of potential reference spectra. Doing this evaluation for every plume-reference pair makes it impossible to do the evaluation in real, or near real time.
	Furthermore taking the minimum in all cases is statistically risky since the good results can occur accidental. The interpretation is thus more easy if the algorithm searches for an appropriate reference in a defined parameter range.\\
	%
	In this thesis a novel approach of identifying an ideal reference spectrum, by considering externel parameters, is introduced. This way a much faster estimation with constant complexity $\mathcal{O}(1)$ is reached.
	But the above described optimal evaluation is used to rate new approach and compare them among each other. The optimal evaluation always choose the reference with the smallest absolute error. We don't use the relative error due to its vulnerability. Using the relative error leads to less precision since the references with the highest BrO column density is preferred.\\
	%
	The results of the algorithm which chooses the reference automatically are described relative to an optimal evaluation. If the relative error is larger than one \textcolor{red}{warum 1??} the data are excluded from the evaluation.\\
	\\
	In the following we examine several methods for choosing the best reference based on the analysis of external parameters. 
	
	\section{Fit data}
	\textcolor{red}{titel zu unspezifisch} \\
	The following chapter analyses fitting the data with a first order polynomial. \Cref{fig:difftemp} to \Cref{fig:diffexptime} show the \ce{BrO}  error as a function of external parameters. Hereby, the curves are symmetric around zero difference in the respective external parameter. Therefore, it is not necessary to distinguish between positive or negative deviations from the equal surrounding conditions. Thus, the absolute differences can be utilized.\\
	\\
	%
	A linear approximation of the \ce{BrO}  error as function of the considered external parameters leads to a variation of  \Cref{calc:err} :
	With linear differentiations of the \ce{BrO}  error with respect to the respective external parameters \Cref{calc:err} can be written as:	
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta \epsilon_{BrO} = a_{t}\cdot\Delta t+a_{ET}\cdot\Delta ET+a_{T}\cdot\Delta T+a_{dt}\cdot\Delta dt +a_{c}\cdot\Delta c + \mathcal{O}\left(OP\right)
		\label{calc:delterr}
	\end{equation}
	%
	To determine the coefficients $a_{x}$ (\Cref{calc:delterr}) the data visualized in \Cref{fig:difftemp}-\ref{fig:diffexptime} where used.  The fitting is done with an ordinary least square linear regression. In particular we used the python function Linear Regression from the library sklearn \citep{SKlearn}. \\
	
	As it can be seen in \Cref{Chap:BROErr} the impact of the different external parameters change for every instrument depending on the location and the instrument themselves. 
	While the \ce{BrO}  error does not show any dependence on some external parameters for some instruments, the error has very strong dependence on the same external parameter at an other instrument. An example is the correlation between \ce{BrO}  error and the difference in daytime of 0.6 for D2J2201\_0 (Nevado Del Ruiz) and a correlation of 0.16 for I2J8546\_0 at the Tungurahua volcano.
	To get a more stable algorithm less external parameter are preferable. Thus, we need to distinguish between the stability of the fit, which improves with less external parameters and quality of the fit, which improves with more external parameters. 
	A preferable strategy is, to find a solution which is valid for all instruments. Moreover, utilizing less external parameters saves computation time.
	One possibility is to use all external parameters where the correlation is above a certain value. Since we want to get a selection valid for all instruments there are two possibilities: The first one is that we decide by using the mean correlation of all instruments. The second option is to use the highest correlation.

Here the utilized combination of external parameters are plotted on the x-axis and the deviation on the y-axis. The ideal combination (lowest deviation) is marked with a red cross.}
		\label{fig:WelcheEP}
	\end{figure}
	To answer this question quantitatively for the fitting routine we evaluated data of Tungurahua and Nevado Del Ruiz with different combinations of the external parameter described in \Cref{Chap:BROErr}. Since we could not observe any correlation between the \ce{BrO} error and the elevation angle the external parameter elevation angle was neglected in this analysis. To rate the results for the single instruments (three at Tungurahua and two at Nevado Del Ruiz) the difference to the "NOVAC-evaluation" is used. Hereby the factor $X$, a quantity which describes the distinction between the NOVAC-Method and the contamination based method, serves as a indicator:
	\begin{equation}
	X = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k}^{n} \frac{E_{ContBased, k}}{E_{novac,k}}
	\label{eq:mean}
	\end{equation}
	$n$ is the total amount of contaminated spectra, $Enovac$ is the relative \ce{BrO}  error, in the NOVAC-evaluation, $EContBased$ is the relative \ce{BrO}  error, in the contamination based-evaluation. 
	\Cref{fig:WelcheEP} shows the $X$ factor for the Tungurahua and the Nevado Del Ruiz volcano. The y-axis shows the factors $X$ averaged over all instrument at the volcanoes.\\
	The factors X change from instrument to instrument. The results for every instrument can be seen in the appendix (\Cref{fig:I2J8548}). The factors X range from 1.18 to 1.42.\\

%	\textcolor{red}{If using the median and not the mean as described in \Cref{eq:mean} our method is mostly better than the "optimal method".--> wenn du schon sagst, dass es mit dem median besser wird, dann schreib auch den Median Wert hin und better than optimal??? besser machen.}
	As it can be seen in \Cref{fig:WelcheEP}  for both volcanoes the $X$ factor is minimal for the combination of the following external parameters:\\

		$\bullet$ Temperature & $\bullet$ Daytime&  $\bullet$ Colorindex & $\bullet$ Temporal Difference\\
		\label{tab:importantexternalParam}
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
%	

	For the final algorithm this combination of external parameters is used.\\	
	The coefficients $a_{x}$ are calculated for each instrument at Nevado Del Ruiz and Tungurahua. Furthermore, the coefficients $a_{x}$ are calculated with the combined data from all instruments installed at one volcano. The results for the Nevado Del Ruiz volcano can be found in \Cref{tab:coefNevad} and for the Tungurahua volcano in \Cref{tab:coefTung}.\\

%	As can be concluded from \Cref{fig:WelcheEP} the best results are found if all parameters are used with a mean correlation above 0.3 (see \Cref{tab:CorrEP}).\\
	\\
	As it is shown in \Cref{Chap:BrOdep}, not only the BrO retrieval error depends on the difference in external parameter but also the BrO SCD (see \Cref{fig:difftempbroallinstruments}). 
	The question is, if the correlation between the BrO error and an considered external parameter as can be seen in \Cref{fig:difftempbroallinstruments}, can also be found in the BrO SCD and the corresponding differences in external paramter of the final choice of the reference, resulting from the fit routine. The answer to this question is No, since the maximal correlation is below 0.01. On Comparison, the maximal correlation if all references are used is above 0.8. Thus we can conclude, that the BrO SCDs resulting from the fit routine do not depend largely on the differences in external parameter.\\
	
	The fitting routine provides a list, where the possible references are sorted by there probable compatibility with the plume spectra. To quantize the influence of the choice of the reference on the BrO SCD, the BrO SCDs, retrieved by using the first 10 spectra of the list provided by the fitting routine are compared.
	For Tungurahua the mean standard deviation between the different BrO SCDs calculated with the different references is 28.7 \% of the mean BrO SCD. The mean BrO retrieval error is 43.8\% of the BrO SCD.
	At Nevado del Ruiz the standard deviation of the BrO SCD is 25.4\% of the mean BrO SCD. The mean BrO retrieval error is 36.9\% of the BrO SCD.

	\section{Other approaches}

	Fitting is not the only possibility of finding the optimal reference out of the list of all possible references.\\
	In the following two additionally possibilities are presented. Both are based on the findings in \cref{Chap:BROErr}. 

\subsection{Nearest neighbor approach}


Beside linear regression also the nearest neighbor approach can be utilized to estimate the BrO error for the evaluation with a potential reference spectrum.
%
The nearest neighbor search \textcolor{red}{referenzieren} describes an optimization problem for a given point $m \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and a set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$:

%

\begin{align}
\bar{s}(m) = \min_{s \in S} d(m, s) \label{eq:1nn}
\end{align}

%
Here $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a distance function that computes the dissimilarity between the two input arguments. Typical distance metrics are the L1 distance $d_{\text{L1} 	
}(m, s) = ||m - s||^2$ or the L2 (also euclidean) distance function $d_{\text{L2} 
}(m, s) = ||m - s||$. 


In many cases not only one nearest neighbor but a set $M$ of $k$ nearest neighbors is of interest. In this case the optimization problem of Eq. \ref{eq:1nn} must be modified to

%

\begin{align}
\bar{S_k}(m) = \min_{S_k \subset S} \sum_{s \in S_k, m \in M} d(s, m) \label{eq:knn}
\end{align}

%

In many cases the nearest neighbor search is used to estimate a target variable $y_m$ for a feature vector $m \in \mathbb{R}^n$. This method assumes a given set feature vectors $S$ for which the target variables $y_S$ are known. Then the target variable $y_m$ for a given $m$ can be estimated by:

%

\begin{align}
y_m = \frac{1}{k} \sum y_S \label{eq:knn_regression}
\end{align}

%

\subsection*{Advantages of the nearest neighbour approach}
	The main advantage of the nearest neighbour method is that there is no need for a pre-assumption of a fitting method. The fitting method assumes that the BrO error depends linearly  on the external parameter. As it can be seen in \Cref{fig:difftemp}-\Cref{fig:diffexptime} this does not need to be the case. Thus, the nearest neighbour method is able to approximate the BrO error as a function of the external data in a more variable way\textcolor{red}{more general}.
%
\subsection*{Disadvantages of the nearest neighbour approach}
	Compared to fitting the data, the nearest neighbour is much slower. The reason for this is, the vast amount of compassion operations that is necessary for each computation. Thus, the calculation time increases with the amount of training data.\\
	To normalize the distances d, the normalization function needs to be chosen and therefore pre-assumptions about feature importance are required.
	The X factor increases by 80\%, from 1.24 for the fitting method 
	to 2.24 for the nearest neighbour method.
	Including the fact, that the results of the nearest neighbor method is worse compared to the fitting method, the disadvantages of the nearest neighbour method outweigh the advantages.

	\subsection{Iterative approach}

	The idea of the iterative method is, that the importance of the individual external parameters are very different, that means if we have the list of possible references, we take all references where the temperature difference is minimal, so we get a new, much smaller list of possible references. From this list we choose all references where the next external parameter for example the daytime is minimal and again get a new list. We proceed this way with the following external parameters. We experiment with the sequence of the parameters, to increase the success of the method. The final sequence is:
	\begin{equation*}
	Temperature \bullet  Daytime  \bullet Colorindex \bullet Temporal\,\, Difference \bullet Exposure \,\, time
	\end{equation*} 
	\subsection*{Advantages of the iterative approach}
	The advantages of the iterative approach is the simple calculation and thus the short calculation time. Since the temperature is by far the external impact with the largest impact on the evaluation it is reasonable to look at first at the temperature, and after that on the other parameters. \\
	Another advantage is, that the external conditions of the resulting references, are in an well-defined framework, similar to the  conditions of the plume. Therefore the systematic errors resulting from the effects on the BrO SCDs (see \Cref{fig:difftempbroallinstruments}) can be kept small.
	\subsection*{Disadvantages of the iterative approach}
	The iterative approach leads to an rigid evaluation of the data. References, which have very similar conditions as the plume could be excluded of the evaluation due to an large difference in one external parameter. The decision for the best suited reference is based on one by one parameter. Thus it is impossible to look at all parameters by the same time.   This could lead to a less optimal evaluation when looking at the BrO error.
	As a result the iterative method has a worse X factor (X=1.73) compared to the nearest neighbour (X=2.24) and the fitting method (X=1.24).

	This chapter shows and discusses the difference of the \ce{SO2}, \ce{BrO} and \ce{BrO}/\ce{SO2}  ratio data when evaluating with the NOVAC-Method, or with the contamination based method.
	The aim is to discover the systematic differences between the different retrievals and to discuss the reliability of the data.\\
	\\
	To obtain the reference leading to an evaluation with minimal expected \ce{BrO}  error, the calculation of \Cref{calc:delterr} and the corresponding coefficients from \Cref{tab:coefTung} (Tungurahua) and \Cref{tab:coefNevad} (Nevado Del Ruiz) are used. 
	For the retrieval only "Multi Add" data are used. The maximal temporal difference between measuring the reference and the plume, accepted for the retrieval, is two weeks. The maximal accepted temperature difference is 3.3 $^{\circ}$C.\\

\end{figure}
	We are interested in the systematic differences if using the contaminated same time references spectrum or a gas free alternative reference.  
	\Cref{fig:diffNovac} shows a comparison of the results of contaminated data if performing the evaluation with the NOVAC-method and the contamination based method. 
	%Only data are used where the \ce{SO2} SCDs evaluated with the contamination based method  lies above the plume limit ($SO2\_SCD>7\cdot 10^{17}\frac{molec}{cm^2}$). Thus, the corresponding \ce{SO2}  SCDs evaluated with NOVAC could be below $7\cdot 10^{17}$. 
	As expected the \ce{SO2}  column densities retrieved by the contamination based method are larger for almost every measurement compared to the NOVAC method. The difference between the \ce{SO2} SCDs retrieved by the conventional NOVAC-method increases slightly with increasing SO2 SCD. Fitting of the data results in a slope of 1.22 (Tungurahua) and 1.16 (Nevado del Ruiz). Thus, we can conclude that  a higher SO2 amount leads to a slightly higher contamination (see \Cref{fig:diffNovac}). The extent of BrO contamination does not seem to depend on the BrO amount. The slope of the linear fit of the BrO SCDs have a slope which does not differ significantly from one. The slope at Tungurahua is 1.01 and for Nevado del Ruiz  is 1.07. \\
	\Cref{fig:diffratio} shows the difference of the \ce{SO2}/\ce{BrO} ratio when performing the evaluation with the NOVAC method and the contamination based method.\\
	(\Cref{fig:diffratiob} , \ref{fig:diffratiod}). \Cref{fig:diffratioa} and \ref{fig:diffratiob} show the results of the contamination based method plotted against the results of the NOVAC method. \Cref{fig:diffratioc}  and \ref{fig:diffratiod} show the actual difference between both methods. The column density calculated with NOVAC is subtracted from the corresponding column density retrieved with the contamination based method.  For low \ce{BrO}/\ce{SO2}  ratios around below zero, the ratios calculated with the contamination based method are higher than the ratios retrieved with the NOVAC method. For higher \ce{BrO}/\ce{SO2}  ratios (above zero) the ratios calculated with the NOVAC method are larger. The absolute difference between both evaluation methods increases with the increase of the 
\textcolor{red}{postives Offset, was ist der Effekt von der höheren Anzahl Datenpunkte}
	Due to the increase of the \ce{SO2}  column density when performing the evaluation with the contamination based method more \ce{SO2}  SCD lies above the plume limit of $7\cdot10^{17}\quad \frac{molec}{cm^2}$. This leads to an increase of the amount of data which show a large \ce{SO2} signal.\\ 
	In the following we discuss the results for the Tungurahua volcano and the Nevado Del Ruiz.

	\label{tab:calc1}
\end{table}



\section{Tungurahua}
	In the considered time interval from June 2008 to August 2009, 6500 multi add spectra are available. \\
	If contamination is not considered
	6.4\% of the evaluated volcanic gas plumes contained \ce{SO2} above the "plume threshold of $7\cdot10^{17}\quad \frac{molec}{cm^2}$. Thus 6.4\% of the data can be used for the examination of the volcanic gas emissions in this timespan.\\
 	The analysis of the reference with an solar atlas spectrum spectra found 6.0 \% of all spectra as contaminated. To prevent a systematic error of the results this spectra need to be excluded from the conventional NOVAC-evaluation if no further calculations are made.\\
 	From the remaining data,  if the contaminated spectra are excluded, only 5.5 \% of the \ce{SO2}  column densities are above the plume limit  (see  Table \ref{tab:calc}). \\
 	A higher amount of spectra above the \ce{SO2}  plume limit can be found in the contaminated data even if the contaminated data are evaluated with the NOVAC-method. Here, the percentage of data in the plume-limit is 0.153\%.
 	This means that the contaminated data are 2.381 times more frequently above the plume limit. This leads to the presumption, that the probability of getting contaminated data increases with the gas amount leaving the volcano.\\
 	The following paragraph deals only with the contaminated data.	
 	When performing the evaluation of the contaminated data with the contamination based method 0.299\% of the resulting \ce{SO2}  column densities are in the plume limit. Thus, the reliable amount of contaminated data increase bya factor of two while the total amount of data increase by 1.8 percent points. Thus 0.073\% of all data are above plume limit when using the contamination based method.\\
 	By using trace gas free references instead of contaminated references about 25.2 \% more data are available. \\

\section{Nevado Del Ruiz}
At Nevado Del Ruiz a larger time span (from the end of 2009 to the end of 2011) is examined. The resulting amount of "Multi Add" data is 14005.
Neglecting contamination and thus evaluate all data using the conventional NOVAC method results in 0.121 of all data above the plume limit. 
%When ignoring contamination and evaluating all spectra with the NOVAC-method 12.8\% of the \ce{SO2} SCDs are above the plume limit.\\
The total amount of contamination data is 1392. This is equivalent to 9.9\% of all data. Evaluating the contaminated data with the NOVAC-method yields in 32.8\% of the cases in SO2 SCDs above the plume limit. As at Tungurahua the occurrence of data above the plume limit within the contaminated data is larger as for not contaminated data (by a factor of 2.7).\\
The following paragraph only deals with the contaminated data.
If using the contamination based method 0.598\% of the \ce{SO2} column densities are above the detection limit. Thus, an increase of the number of detected \ce{SO2} SCDs above the plume limit within the contaminated data of 95\% is observable. In total the number of \ce{SO2} SCDs above the plume limit increases by 2.7 percent points. As a result 14.8\% of all data are above the plume limit.\\

	\label{fig:ndrso2novacsametime}
\end{figure}	

	%
	Contaminated data either need to be excluded from the evaluation or to corrected due to using a not contaminated reference. If the contaminated data are excluded from the evaluation, the amount of data where the corresponding SO2 amount is above the plume limit is significantly smaller. The additionally data retrieved by using the contamination based method can be seen in \Cref{fig:tungso2novacsametime} for Tungurahua (visualized with red circles) respectively for Nevado del Ruiz in \Cref{fig:ndrso2novacsametime}.
	The time series of Tungurahua and Nevado del Ruiz show, that contamination occurs rather frequently at high SO2 and BrO column densities. The share of contaminated data above a SO2 SCD of $2e18\frac{molec}{cm^2}$ is significantly higher as below (see \Cref{fig:ndrso2novacsametime} for Nevado del Ruiz and \Cref{fig:tungso2novacsametime} for the Tungurahua volcano). High BrO SCDs (above $1e14\frac{molec}{cm^2}$) are as well above average contaminated data.\\
	While the SO2 SCDs and BrO SCDs increase on average due to using the contaminated data the average BrO/SO2 ratio does not chance significantly compared to the average ratio when only using not contaminated data, as can be seen in \Cref{fig:tungso2novacsametime} for Tungurahua (the plot at the bottom) or in \Cref{fig:ndrso2novacsametime} for Nevado del Ruiz.\\

The other data are colored in green.}
		\label{fig:dailymeanstungurahua}
	\end{figure}
	\subsection*{Daily Means}
	
	 Due to the very small amount of volcanic gas plumes with 
	\ce{BrO}  column densities above the detection limit often the daily mean of the \ce{BrO}/\ce{SO2}  ratios is used. Hereby at least four "Multi Adds" per day above the plume limit are considered in order to avoid outliers. Thus, performing the evaluation of contaminated data with the contamination based method leads to more data.\textcolor{red}{wie gehts eigentlich dem mitteleren BrO/SO2 fehler? (also (BrO/SO2)/sqrt(datenpunkte an dem tag) )}
	%Some days which had less than  three to four valid data points could then have four or more multi adds. 
	At Tungurahua In fact 30.8\% more daily mean data can be retrieved when using the contamination based method compared to exclude the contaminated data. The amount of daily means increases less than the total amount of data, this effect can be explained due to a higher occurrence of contamination if the \ce{SO2}  column densities are high, thus more data are retrieved for days with a high \ce{SO2}  amount.
	In the considered time period we have data on 365 days. 
	If we exclude the contaminated data from the evaluation we get at 36 days daily means (more than 4 valid data points per day). If the contamination problem is neglected at 43 days daily means are retrieved. At 52 days we can calculate daily means if we use the contamination based method this is equivalent to 14.\% of all data.\\

	At Nevado del Ruiz the amount of daily means increases by 27.9\%. if the contaminated data are used compared to the scenario where the contaminated data are excluded.
	In total we have data at 688 days.	When excluding the contaminated data it total there are 165.
	If the contamination problem is neglected the total amount of daily means in the evaluated time period is 198. And if we use the contamintion based method for the contaminated data we get an total amount of 229 data. This is  equivalent to 33\% of all data. Thus we have twice at much daily means at Nevado del Ruiz compared to Tungurahua.
	
	\Cref{fig:dailymeanstungurahua} shows a time series of Daily means of the BrO/\ce{SO2} ratio. The minimum amount of valid data point within one day is above 4. Days where 3 or less valid data where recorded are not considered in this figure.  Thus all considered ratios have an \ce{SO2} SCD above the plume limit. The red marked ratios shows daily means which includes at least one contaminated spectra.

	\section{Issues of the contamination based method}
	\textcolor{red}{diese Besprechung ist vielleicht vorne im Kapitel zu Kontaminierung besser aufgehoben. Da dann 8.6. als realistischen/klassischen Fall beschreiben. Also ohne Korrektur unterschätzung, mit korrektur überschätzung. Den unkorrigeten Fall kennen wir schon, du (und vor dir auch Lübcke et al 2016) untersuchen jetzt den korrigierten (überschätzen Fall). Die Wahrheit liegt vermutlich irgendwo dazwischen aber können wir zum heutigen Stand nicht ermitteln. Dann ist klar was du vor hast und wie die folgenden ergebnisse interpretiert werden müssen/dürfen. Und es gibt nicht am ende der Arbeit ein großes Aber. Figure 8.7 kann/sollte auch schon vorne kommen. Mit dem Verweis, dass wir solche Fälle ignorieren bzw. annehmen dass nur 8.6. vorliegt.}
	The contamination method is arguable because it does not consider contamination of the plume due to a lack of information. Moreover, we do not consider the different lifetimes of \ce{SO2} and BrO. This leads to a faster depletion of BrO.
	\textcolor{red}{die besprechung der Lebensdauern muss noch ausführlicher werden. Insbesondere implizieren deine Daten, dass die BrO Lebensdauer relative lange ist. Ansonsten wäre ja zumindest eine Kontaminierung vom Tag davor nicht möglich. Das sollte auf jeden Fall einen ausführlich besprochenes ergebnis sein. Passend dazu eine Frage: Ist die Kontaminierung eigentlich vornehmlich morgens aufgetreten? Denn nachts kommt ja genauso viel \ce{Hbr} aus dem Vulkan, nur dass es eben nicht umgesetzt wird. (Memo an mich selbst!! :-D )}
	\subsection{Contamination of the plume}

	\end{figure}

Right: the plume covers the hole sky, thus all elvation angles "see" volcanic trace gases. }

	 As discussed above it occurs, that the plume is contaminated as well (see \Cref{fig:contaminationplume}). This might be the case if the volcanic gas of the volcano is not taken away by the wind, but accumulates in the vicinity of the volcano and thus is seen by the instrument. In such a scenario, using an contamination free reference recorded at another time would lead to an overestimation of the gas column densities in the plume.\\
	 This is one possible occurence of contamination. As it can be seen gas of the old plume affects the measurement of the reference and the plume. However, for this example the influence on the measurement of the reference is much larger since the light path trough the old plume (coloured orange in \Cref{fig:contaminationplume}) is longer for the reference than for the measurement of the volcanic plume. Thus, we underestimate the gas amount if we do not use a gas free reference, but might overestimate if we do so.
	 The real gas amount might be between the measured amount with and without using a reference measured at another time.\\
	 The contamination setup could differ from \Cref{fig:contaminationplume}. This would lead to different results. However, the reference region is in most cases at a larger elevation angle than the plume. Thus, the assumption that the light path trough the old plume is in average longer for the reference, if both, reference and plume are contaminated.
	 
	  With the data retrieved by the NOVAC instruments it is very difficult or even impossible to discover whether the plume is contaminated or not. \\
%	
%	\textcolor{red}{
%	\cite{geeignete quelle, irgendwo hab ich das schon gehoert} made investigations on the lifetime of \ce{SO2} and BrO. The lifetime of \ce{SO2} is several weeks, while the decay of BrO proceed in smaller time scales. As a result we should observe a lower contamination for BrO. This can be observed in our results. In theory it can be that due to the smaller lifetimes of BrO contamination only influences the \ce{SO2} evaluation, if that is the case, the best option would be to use a high defined solar atlas spectrum as reference for the \ce{SO2} evaluation, but an reference recorded with the same instrument at the same time for the BrO evaluation, since BrO could not be retrieved using an high defined solar atlas spectrum.}


	\chapter{Conclusion}
	
	The Network for Observation of Volcanic and Atmospheric Change provides a very large of longtime timeseries. This treasure of the data contains a huge amount of informations about volcanoes, which give an interesting insight of the physical foundations on volcanic activity.\\
	The evaluation of the volcanoes is is in particular based on the assumption that the atmospheric background of the volcanic trace gases \ce{SO2} and BrO is negligible. This is important to assure since the DOAS method only captures the difference in gas amount between the background, the reference and the signal, the plume spectra.\\
	By the usage of a solar atlas spectrum as reference, \citet{lubcke2014bro} found  that the reference provided by the NOVAC-Instrument is not always gas free. Thus is contaminated with volcanic trace gases. If that is the case the contaminated spectra either needs to be excluded from the evaluation or the contaminated reference needs to be replaced by a gas free reference. If we want to keep the contaminated data we need to find an appropriate gasfree reference. A solar atlas spectrum can not be used for the BrO evlaution due to the low amount of BrO and the increase of the BrO error if using a solar atlas spectrum. Thus, a gasfree reference recorded by the same instrument is a possible choice.\\
	As the instruments are recoring continously, there are multiple potential gasfree reference spectra available for each plume spectrum. Due to the low accuracy of the BrO retrieval it is reasonably to choose the reference with respect to the BrO error.
	An analysis of the if the dependency of the BrO error on several external parameters is presented. Hereby we focus on the temporal difference and the differences in temperature, Colorindex, exposure time, elevation angle and daytime between the plume and the reference spectra. These external parameters are found crucial for the retrieved BrO error. The dependence of the BrO column density on external parameters was discussed as well. 
	\\
	The result of this analysis, that in general the retrieved BrO error is minimal, if the considered parameter are similar for the plume and reference. Only the elevation angle does not seem to influence the retrieval. From the considered parameter the temperature has the most significant impact of 60\% up to 97\% compared to the other parameters, at all observed instruments at Tungurahua as well as at the Nevado Del Ruiz volcano. The importance of the other instruments are different for every instrument, depending on the location of the instrument and the instrument itself.\\
	If both, the the reference and the plume a recorded at the same time all those external parameter are  identical which corresponds to the minimal expected error however might include involve a systematic error due to contamination.\\
	Based on this findings an algorithm is introduced to automatically find the alternative reference if the reference, which is measured at the same time as the plum spectrum, to be replaced due to contamination.\\
	Fitting the data with a four dimensional first order polynomial turned out to give the best estimation of the expected error on the trace gas measurement.\\
	The evaluation of the contaminated data with the here proposed algorithm shows that BrO as well as \ce{SO2} was underestimated by ignoring the contamination problem.
	We shows that the contamination based method in average estimates the value of the BrO column destiny by 1.2$\cdot$ e+13 higher at Tungurahua (2.0e13 Nevado Del Ruiz). The \ce{SO2} amount increases as well by an amount of 6.5$\cdot$ e+17 at Tungurahua (7.4$\cdot$ e+17 Nevado Del Ruiz) . Thus, the results for the BrO/\ce{SO2} ratio calculated with the contamination based method changed compared to the conventional method in the way, that low ratios increases, while high ratios decrease.\\
	A further advantage of the new calculation is, that due to the higher amount of the \ce{SO2} SCDs the amount of data above the plume limit increases. Using the contamination based method leads to an total increase of data of 45 \% (Tungurahua) and 87\% (Nevado Del Ruiz).\\
	\\
	The Method proposed in this thesis improves the evaluation of the spectra provided by NOVAC and eliminates the systematic error occurring due to contamination. As a result the amount of usable data increases. This is a important step fo a better understanding of volcanoes.
