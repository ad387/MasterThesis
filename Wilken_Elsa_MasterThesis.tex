		Network for Observation of Volcanic and Atmospheric Change (NOVAC) is a network of instruments monitoring volcanoes over the hole world. 
		The aim of NOVAC is to gain another tool for risk assessment, for gas emissions and geophysical researches. Also many other scientific purposes are build on the data from NOVAC.\\
		\Cref{fig:novac2015} shows a map, with all volcanoes of the Network for Obersavation of Volcanic and Atmospheric Change.\\
		%
		NOVAC was originally funded by the European Union on the first October in 2005. The aim of NOVAC is to  establish  a  global  
		network  of  stations  for  the  quantitative  measurement  of  volcanic gas  emissions. At the beginning NOVAC encompassed observatories of 15 volcanoes in Africa America and Europe, including some of the most active and strongest degassing volcanoes in the world. Although the EU-funding has stopped, the network has been constantly growing since it was founded. In 2017 more than 80 Instruments are installed at over 30 volcanoes in more than 13 countries.\\
		The great advantage of the data monitored in NOVAC is the fact
		that NOVAC provides continues gas emission data over many years. Therefore one is able to get more statistical stable results.\\
		The instruments used in NOVAC are scanning UV-spectrometer : Mini Doas instruments. \\
		The  Mini-DOAS  instrument  represents  a  major  breakthrough  in  volcanic  gas	monitoring as it is capable of real-time semi-continuous unattended measurement of the total emission fluxes of  SO2	and BrO from a volcano. Semi-continues means in this case that the measurement is only possible during day time when enough Sun light is there.\\
		%
		The  basic  mini-DOAS  system  consists  of  a  pointing  telescope  fiber-coupled  to  a  spectrograph.  
		Ultraviolet light from the sun, scattered from aerosols and molecules in the atmosphere, is collected by 
		means  of  a  telescope  with  a  quartz  lens  defining  a  field-of-view  of  12  mrad.
		\ref{NOVAC Seite} \\
		The spectrometers measure in the UV region in a wavelength range of 280 to 420 nm. In this range are the differential structures of SO2 and BrO dominant.
		\\
 		The Novac-instruments need to be very robust to stand the conditions around volcanoes. Therefore the design of the instruments is rather simple, this means the instruments do not have internal stabilisation features like temperature stabilization to keep the measurement independent of external parameters (for example Temperature).
		This comes along with a reduced precision of the data, but the huge amount of data produced by NOVAC compensates this disadvantage.  
	
	
	\chapter{Measurement Routine}
	The Instruments are set up five to ten km downwind of the volcano of the volcano. To cover most of the occurring wind directions two to five instruments are installed at each volcano. Ideally the measurement plane is orthogonal to the plume, to get the best measurement results. In reality the measurement plane could be twisted.\\
	The Instruments record spectra in different viewing angles covering a the hole sky from horizon to horizon from 
	-90$^{\circ}$ to 90$^{\circ}$. The zenith is at 0$^{\circ}$.
	The measurement routine starts with a spectrum in zenith direction: The pre-reference.
	Afterwards the dark current spectrum is recorded.\\
	Then the Instrument turns automatically to the side, recording spectra at the Elevation Angle from -90$^{\circ}$ to 90$^{\circ}$ with steps of 3.6$^{\circ}$. \\
	One hole measurement takes from 6 to 15 minutes.
	\chapter{Evaluation Routine}
	\section{NOVAC-Evaluation}
	In the following we describe the technical implementation of the DOAS approach using the data of NOVAC instruments:\\
	The first important task is to locate volcano plume and the reference region using the data from te measurement routine described above.
	
	To do so we use the pre-reference (the spectra recorded at an elevation angle of  0$^{\circ} $) to evaluate spectra for SO2 at every elevation angle as described in chapter \ref{DOAS}, that means we divide each recorded spectra by the pre-reference and take the logarithm  to get rid of the Frauenhofer structures and to be able to just look at the important structures of the plume. To get the gas amounts of the evaluated spectra, one fits the absorption spectrum of all important gases on the spectrum. In our case we take all gases written in tab. \ref{tab: 1} into account. The result will be an SO2 curve as it is shown in fig. \ref{fig so2}.
	Figure \ref{fig so2} shows the relative SO2 column density to the pre-reference as a function of the elevation angle. We can clearly observe a a maximum of SO2 and a minimum. Inside the plume the SO2 amount is much higher than in the outside the plume. Therefore we assume that the location of the SO2 maximum match with the location of the plume. We assume that the minimum of the SO2 curve refers to a region outside of the plume which is in most times the case. The SO2 amount in the earths atmosphere is negligible so we take it as a region of zero SO2. Now it is possible to locate the plume region as the SO2 maximum, whereas the minimum of the SO2 curve the reference region is. \\
	To technically detect the plume region we use a gauss fit of the So2 curve.
	To increase the quality and to get a more robust result the sum over several plume spectra is taken. If the gauss curve is too wide we use only the 10 spectra with the highest SO2 amount. For the reference we use the sum of 10 spectra with the lowest SO2 amount.\\
	%
	The so found reference spectrum is used to fit it on the SO2 absorption lines of Gases to get the absolute column densities of SO2 and BrO in the plume spectrum\\
	\\
	Since the BrO column density is much lower than the SO2 column density and lies just slightly above the detection limit the plume is hard to detect using the BrO column density as it is shown in fig. \ref{ fig bro}. 
	Therefore we use plume location we found by using SO2 to evaluate the BrO column density.\\
	For the evaluation we use the data of more than one measurement, to increase the fit quality.\\
	We are mainly interested in the BrO/SO2 ratio, with the calculations described above it is now possible the get this ratio.
	In \cref{...} is the NOVAC Evaluation visualized.
	
	

	\section{Contamination Problem}
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Bilder/contaminated}
		\caption{}
		\label{fig:contaminated}
	\end{figure}
	
	It might occur that in rare (ca. 10\% of the data) scenarios, the
	volcanic plume covers the whole scan region.
	This could happen if for example the volcanic plume of the day before still extend over the hole scan area as a consequence of windless conditions.
	In consequence, the reference	is contaminated with volcanic trace gases. Thus the gas amount is underestimated by the NOVAC-Evaluation: In \cref{fig:contaminated} we see an example from April 2011 (Tungurahua) where the reference region is contaminated by volcanic trace gases. The blue SO2 curve shows our calculations with the NOVAC-Evaluation, but since there is still SO2 in the reference region, therefore the assumption, that the SO2 amount could be set to zero in the reference region is wrong. The red curve shows the real SO2 curve, and we will underestimate the total SO2 amount of the plume. Contamination occur in approximately 10$\%$ of the data.\\
	\\
	If the reference region is for any reason
	contaminated by volcanic trace gases, the reference spectrum has to be
	replaced by a volcanic-gas-free reference. Alternative spectra are a
	theoretical solar atlas spectrum (the use of a solar atlas spectrum will be described in \cref{kuruz}) ore a a volcanic-gas-free reference
	spectrum recorded by the same instrument.\\ 
	%
	\\
	%
	In the following we will discuss both of these options:
	%
	\subsection*{Evaluation using a Solar Atlas Spectrum \label{kuruz}}
	An alternative to choose the region with the lowest column density as reference region is to use a theoretical high resolution solar atlas spectrum as reference \cite{chance2010improved}.
	The use of a theoretical solar atlas spectrum as a reference which is completely volcanic-trace-gases-free was first proposed by \cite{lubcke2014bro}.
	The advantage of using a solar atlas spectrum as reference is, that we know that there are no volcanic trace gases, we do not need to assume, that the minimum SO2 amount is zero. The disadvantage is, that using a solar atlas spectrum comes along with a drawback of precision: A theoretical solar atlas spectrum is far more precise than the spectra of the NOVAC instruments therefore the instrument functions need to be modeled and added to the retrieval.\\ 
	The reduction of precision is acceptable for the
	SO2 retrieval but not suitable for a BrO retrieval because then most data would be below the detection limit.\\
%
\\
%
	Possible contaminations can be checked
	by a theoretical solar atlas spectrum to evaluate the SO2 amount in the reference.

	\subsection*{Evaluation using a Spectrum of the same Instrument}
	An alternative reference spectrum coud be a a volcanic-gas-free reference
	spectrum recorded by the same instrument. When using such a reference several problems occur:\\
	As described in \cref{NOVAC} the instruments used in NOVAC do not include features like temperature stabilisation due to that the measurements are not independent from external parameters. 
	So we need to choose a reference recorded at similar conditions with respect to meteorology and	radiation as well as in the temporal proximity due to instrumental changes with time and ambient conditions. Ideally the external conditions should be equal to the conditions when the plume was recorded.\\
	\\
	%
	\\
	In this work we will combine both options in order to
	achieve both, enhanced accuracy but still maximum possible precision of
	the SO2 and BrO retrievals. So we use the solar atlas spectrum to check for 
	contamination and a reference spectrum recorded in temporal proximity by the same instrument as reference.\\
	\\
	%
	\\
	In the following we will discuss how to find the an optimal reference from another scan automatically.

	\chapter{Limitations for the evaluation of  BrO}
    Since the SO2 amount in a volcano plume is rather high (magnitude of SO2 at Tungurahua $\approx 1e^{18}$, \cite{WarnachSimon}) , the evaluation of SO2 is unproblematic compared to BrO.\\
	Evaluating BrO is more difficult since the amount is much smaller and the measurement error relative to the column density much larger. Since we want to get the BrO/SO2 we need to maximize the accuracy of BrO.
	Therefore the aim is to choose the reference with respect to the BrO error, to minimize the BrO Error and to increase the amount of reliable BrO/SO2 ratio data.\\
	We figured out, that the BrO Error depends strongly on the surrounding conditions when recording the plume and the reference. In the following, we will take a closer look at the dependence of the BrO error on external parameters. 
	%
	\section{BrO Error dependence on external parameters}
	%HOW IS THE ERROR CALCULATED AND WHY AND DETECTION LIMIT (PLATT \& STUTZ)
	The measurement and evaluation depends on the surrounding conditions like temperature or cloudiness \cite{lubcke2014optical}\\
	If choosing a new reference we need to take the surrounding conditions into account\\
	The better the surrounding conditions of the time where the reference is measured coincide with the conditions of the time when the plume is measured, the lower is the BrO error \\
	The surrounding conditions we take into account are temperature, colorindex, exposure time, elevation-angle, daytime and the temporal difference.\\
	In almost all cases (99\%) the absolute BrO Error is minimal when using the reference recorded at the same time as te plume spectrum. So we won't be able to get an BrO Error which is smaller than the "Same Time Error".   

	
	\subsection{Time}
	Due to instrument drifts the fit quality decreases with the time difference between recording the plume and the reference. Therefore it is better to use an reference in temporal proximity.\\
	%
	\Cref{shiftPic} shows the Instrumental drift as a function of time, to create \cref{shiftPic} we used Tungurahua data, 2008 from June to November. We can observe that the drift changes with time. If we use the reference and plume spectra of the same time, we do not need to care about these effects, since the shift is equal for the plume and reference spectrum, but if the recording time is not the same the quality of the fit changes with the differences in wavelength shift which increases with the time difference.\\
	We found out that the time interval where it is still reasonable to use references is about 14 days. Therefore we only use references where the recording time difference between plume and reference is smaller than two weeks. When using a references with a temporal difference to the plume of more than 14 days the probability, that the fit quality and thus the BrO error increases to much for our purposes. ??????????????????

	\begin{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	The BrO error doesn't depend significantly on the difference between the Elevation Angles. This could have several reasons. One problem is, that the Elevation Angle of Plume and Reference spectrum is not the same. This could also be a reason of uncertainty of the evaluations of the plume spectrum.

	\chapter{Method}
	\section{Fit data}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A Spectrum is treated as contaminated if the SO2 column density of the reference (evaluated with a solar atlas spectrum) is larger as 2$\cdot 10^{17}\frac{molec}{cm^2}$.
		\item Plume data are reliable if the SO2 column density is larger as 7 $\cdot 10^{17} \frac{molec}{cm^2}$
		\item Data are above the detection limit if the column density as two times larger than the fit error.
		\item If the reference is contaminated:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We have a list of possible references where all references are not contaminated and the temporal distance to the plume date is no longer than 14 days.
			\item we calculate of all possible references the differences in the external parameters
			\item We use the analyse of external parameters described above to estimate the BrO error of all references
			\item We choose the reference with the smallest estimated BrO error as new reference
			\item We evaluate the plume spectra with the new reference.

	\chapter{Issues of our method}
	\section{Contamination of the plume}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item As discussed above it might occur, that, that the reference is contaminated for example by the plume of the day before. If that happens, we underestimate the gas amount by using a contaminated reference. But another possibility is, that the plume is also contaminated. This might be the case if the volcanic gas of the volcano is not taken away by the wind, but accumulates in the plume. If this is the case, using an other reference would lead to an overestimation of the column density of gases.
